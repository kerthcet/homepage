R&D engineer living in Cambridge UK, right now working at [Hiverge.ai](https://www.hiverge.ai/) as the founding engineer. I enjoy building scalable infrastructure and ML systems.

My background spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, DevOps & MLOps & LLMOps. These days I mainly focus on developing AI agents and model inference systems. I'm also the founder of [InftyAI](https://github.com/InftyAI), an open-source community dedicated to building solid AI infrastructure, including projects like [llmaz](https://github.com/InftyAI/llmaz) and [AlphaTrion](https://github.com/InftyAI/alphatrion). If you're interested, we'd love to have you join us!

Additionally, I work on upstream [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) community as SIG-Scheduling Maintainer and help incubate several projects like [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue), [LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws). Meanwhile, serving as the Tech Lead of the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Tag Workloads.

In my spare time, I run some side projects like [ModelSpec.ai](https://modelspec.ai/), which aims to be the model hub and benchmark platform for AI models, still in early development.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss something related to AI, cloud, open source or starting a new business.
