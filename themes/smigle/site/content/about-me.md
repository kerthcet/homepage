R&D engineer living in Cambridge UK. Currently working at [Hiverge.ai](https://www.hiverge.ai/) as the founding engineer. Also the founder of [InftyAI](https://inftyai.com) and [ModelSpec.ai](https://modelspec.ai/).  I enjoy building scalable infrastructure and ML systems.

My background spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure and ML systems. These days I mainly focus on developing AI agents and model inference systems, including projects like [llmaz](https://github.com/InftyAI/llmaz) (serving platform) and [AlphaTrion](https://github.com/InftyAI/alphatrion) (AI observability). If you're interested, we'd love to have you join us!

Additionally, I work on upstream [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) community as SIG-Scheduling Maintainer and help incubate several projects like [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue), [LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws). Meanwhile, serving as the Tech Lead of the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Tag Workloads.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss something related to AI, cloud, open source or starting a new business.
