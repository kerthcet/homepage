### Session: SIG-Scheduling Deep Dive

[[Slides](https://github.com/kerthcet/Slides/blob/main/year2022/kubecon-na/sig-scheduling-deepdive.pdf)]

SIG Scheduling is responsible for kube-scheduler and its related subprojects such as the scheduling-plugins and descheduler. These projects share the common goal of enabling users and developers to ensure that pods are assigned to the appropriate nodes based on various scheduling criteria. We also endeavor to ease customizing and extending scheduler for advanced usage. This talk will introduce attendees to SIG-Scheduling with an overview of the current goals and ongoing work within the SIG, as well as opportunities for new contributors to get involved.

Unfortunately, can't attend this session in person due to the visa issue.
