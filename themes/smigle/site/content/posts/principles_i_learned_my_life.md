10 principles I've learned in my life -- continuously updating. No particular order.

1. Figure out what not to do is just as important as the opposite. Good at one thing rather than know three things.

2. Persistence is also a gift. Find out what is valuable and repeat it, what is invalid and avoid it.

3. Unity of knowledge and action. Talk is cheap, show me the action.

4. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can make you better.

5. Failing to plan is planning to fail. No milestone, no progress.

6. Think big, start small. All great things start from small.

7. Price your time. Pay for it or delegate it if not worth the cost.

8. Chase growth, not comfort. This makes you different from the ordinary.

9. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

10. Develop a love for a sport. It builds your body and fortifies your mentality.
