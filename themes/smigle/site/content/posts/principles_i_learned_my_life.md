10 principles I've learned in my life -- continuously updating. No particular order.

1. Embrace minimalism. It simplifies your life and knowing what not to do is just as important as the opposite.

2. Be long-termist. Don't follow the trends, find out what is valuable and repeat it, what is invalid and avoid it.

3. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can make you better.

4. Failing to plan is planning to fail. No milestone, no progress.

5. Think big, start small. All great things start from a small step.

6. Price your time. Pay for it or delegate it if not worth the cost.

7. Chase growth, not comfort in decision-making. This makes you different from the ordinary.

8. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

9. Cultivate a love for a sport. Life is a marathon, good health lets you run farther.

10. Unity of knowledge and action. Or the other nine principles are meaningless.
