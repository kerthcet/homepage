10 principles I've learned in my life -- continuously updating. No particular order.

1. Figure out what not to do is just as important as the opposite. Identify what is valuable and repeat it, what is invalid and avoid it.

2. Persistence is also a gift. Be patient and you'll be rewarded.

3. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can make you better.

4. Failing to plan is planning to fail. No milestone, no progress.

5. Think big, start small. All great things start from small.

6. Price your time. Pay for it if it's not worth it.

7. Chase growth, not comfort. This makes you different from the ordinary.

8. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

9. Develop a love for a sport. It builds your body and fortifies your mentality.

10. Life is a marathon. Don't rush and run at your own pace, time will tell everything.
