10 principles I've learned in my life -- continuously updating. No particular order.

1. Figure out what not to do is just as important as the opposite. Good at one thing rather than know three things.

2. Persistence is also a gift. Find out what is valuable and repeat it, what is invalid and avoid it.

3. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can make you better.

4. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Time will be wasted slowly, then suddenly.

5. Prioritize things. Focus on the 20% that brings 80% of the results.

6. Pay for your time. Invest your time in what matters most.

7. Don't chase easy, chase growth.

8. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

9. Train your body, reinforce mental toughness.

10. Life is a marathon. Don't rush and run at your own pace, time will tell everything.
