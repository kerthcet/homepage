10 principles I've learned in my life -- continuously updating. No particular order.

1. Figure out what not to do is just as important as the opposite. Good at one thing rather than know three things.

2. Do not blindly follow the new trend. What changes a person is not a whim, but the repetitive behavior. Find out what is valuable and repeat it, what is invalid and avoid it.

3. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can push you to succeed.

4. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Time will be wasted slowly and then suddenly.

5. Always choose the harder way. It's less crowded and more rewarding, more challenging as well.

6. Pay for your time. Invest your time in what matters most.

7. Build antifragility. Learn from failure, resilient to stress, never bet the farm.

8. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

9. Develop a love for a sport. It builds your body, relieves the stress and satisfies yourself.

10. Life is a marathon. Run at your own pace, don't compare, never quit and always believe in yourself.
