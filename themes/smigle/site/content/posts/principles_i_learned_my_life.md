10 principles I’ve learned in my life — continuously updated. No particular order, and not meant to teach — just sharing my experience.

1. Less is more. Knowing what not to do is just as important as the opposite.

2. Don't follow the trend. Identify the most important problem in your field and focus on it.

3. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can make you better.

4. Failing to plan is planning to fail. No milestone, no progress.

5. Think big, start small. Everything great started from a small beginning.

6. Price your time. Pay for it or delegate the task if not worth the cost.

7. Chase growth, not comfort. This makes you different from the ordinary.

8. Persistence is also a gift. All your efforts will pay off one day.

9. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

10. Unify knowledge and action. Or the other nine principles are meaningless.
