10 principles I've learned in my life -- continuously updating. No particular order.

1. Less is more (minimalism). Knowing what not to do is just as important as the opposite.

2. Be a long-termist. Don't follow the trends, find out what is valuable and repeat it, what is invalid and avoid it.

3. You're the average of the people around you. Surround yourself with people who can make you better.

4. Failing to plan is planning to fail. No milestone, no progress.

5. Think big, start small. All great things begin with a simple small step.

6. Price your time. Either pay for it or delegate it if not worth the cost.

7. Chase growth, not comfort. This makes you different from the ordinary.

8. Take good care of your family. They're the backbone of your life.

9. Life is a marathon. Stay at the table, and your moment will come.

10. Unity of knowledge and action. Or the other nine principles are meaningless.
