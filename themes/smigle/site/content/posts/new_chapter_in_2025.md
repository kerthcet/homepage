I joined DaoCloud in July 7th, 2021, almost 4 years ago, it's an amazing journey for me I have to say. I've learned a lot, experienced a lot, and grown a lot during this period of time. I am really grateful for all the support and trust DaoCloud has given me, or I can not be who I am today.

In the past 4 years, I mainly focused on Kubernetes and AI. I started to contribute to upstream Kubernetes and finally became the SIG-Scheduling Maintainer, I also helped incubate several projects like [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue), a kubernetes-native job queueing system, which I believe is the default solution for running batch workloads on Kubernetes, and has been adopted by many companies in the industry, like DaoCloud, Google, IBM, RedHat, SkyPilot and many other ones not mentioned here. Also the [LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws), a new deploy pattern to serve cross-node LLMs because of the tremendous size of model weights. It has been used by many companies as well, like the AlibabaCloud, AWS, DaoCloud, Google, MistralAI, Nvidia ... Many more projects I have participated in, I won't list them all here, but you can find them in my [github](https://github.com/kerthcet).

Seeing these projects being used by so many companies and communities brings me a lot of joy, and I feel really proud of being part of them. However, everything has two sides, sometimes I may struggle as well, especially when I have to maintain more than two or three projects at the same time, I rarely have time to focus on other things, also the timezone problem. But, you will regain energy and motivation each time you attend the KubeCon, I have attended more or less 6 KubeCons in the past 4 years, and I really enjoy having face-to-face conversations with all the friends and community members, sharing ideas and experiences, and learning from each other.

Nothing lasts forever, with the AI boom, I feel like I need to shift my focus to AI more, it's time to say goodbye and start a new chapter now. Lucky enough, a stealth AI startup based in Cambridge, London has approached me and offered me a founding engineer position. What it does is **Discovering better algorithms via LLMs to solve open problems in real world**, which I think is a great fit for my skills and interests, and the best part is that I can still work on open source projects, fantastic! I may talk more about this in the future, but considering we're still in stealth mode, I can't disclose too much information at this moment, but that day will come soon, I promise.

In regard to the InftyAI community, I will still be around, continue to contribute to the community and help it grow, just as the InftyAI's mission states: **Exploring the infinite possibilities of AI**. I truly hope to build solid solutions for the AI infrastructures and make everyone in the community succeed in their careers, just like how I benefited from the Kubernetes community. And no doubt that I will keep contributing to the Kubernetes community as well, the whole Kubernetes ecosystem is still the best place to carry out AI workloads.

Last but not the least, let's keep in touch, I believe we'll have a lot of cooperations in the future, and if you're interested, welcome to join us in the [InftyAI](https://github.com/InftyAI) community and follow us, we will keep you updated on the latest developments and innovations of our community. Next time you visit Cambridge, feel free to reach out, I will be happy to meet you in person.
