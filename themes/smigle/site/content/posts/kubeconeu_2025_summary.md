Just finished the KubeCon EU 2025 and will end my vocation tomorrow, I'm going to write down something to summarize my KubeCon trip.

So before the KubeCon, I took a view of the schedule and sponsors, different from KubeCon China's very few sponsors and most of the sessions are AI related, the KubeCon EU is really a more grander and diverse event, I think the community will publish a transparency report on this later and the attendee number already proves this, over 13,000 people engaged in the event, which is a new record.

Regarding to the event itself, I've been joined KubeCon as a speaker for more than 5 times, and because I'm focused on AI stuff these days, I have more eyes on AI sessions, however, I would like to say that most of the AI sessions of this KubeCon are not that attractive, all the same old stuff, and always the same projects, I'm really tired of them. But I can somehow understand this because it's hard to nominate a new project and get it accepted by the KubeCon committee, they don't have enough confidence to this. But I do hope to see more innovations to tackle AI challenges. The most interesting session I've heard is about how run.ai accelerates the model downloading via loading model weights directly to GPU memory, which is highly related to what I'm doing right now.

Actually it's my easiest KubeCon ever because I only have one lighting talk and no booth this time. However, I can not understand why the lighting talk speakers can not get a free ticket.

The rest is all about connections. Have great talks with all the guys across the community, like the Kueue, Kubeflow, Kubernetes, vLLM. KubeCon is always about sharing and growth.

Looking forward to the next KubeCon HK in June, I will have a keynote this time, can't wait to back to work now.
