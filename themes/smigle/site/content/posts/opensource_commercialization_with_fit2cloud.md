I just read the [article][article] about the business mode with open source commercialization in fit2cloud, which is really impressive, so I wrote down some highlights here for future reference. _Note that, the original article was written in Chinese_.

For short, fit2cloud business mode is based on the open source **freemium model**, the essential parts of the mode is:

- **Huge user base and keep growing**
- **Increasing paid conversion rate**

Simple but right to the point.

To growing their user base, fit2cloud did a bunch of things, for a summary:

- **easy to use**: they focused on the user experience rather than the function at the beginning, I totally agree with the decision
- **easy to access**: they provided several ways to install their software and offered an online playground for trial
- **software propagation**: they provided a lot of documents, tutorials, and videos to help users to understand their software, they also cooperated with some high schools and universities for training courses
- **community building**: they built a community to help users to solve problems and share experiences

Besides, to reach a border user base, they partnered with other softwares to offer **a more comprehensive solution**, and **break into the overseas market**, which is a smart strategy for a proven open source project I think. In open source world, the winner takes all.

To increase the paid conversion rate, I think there's no special secret, like offering **more functions** for the paid users, and **better support**.

What I totally agree with the opinion of the article is **end users are becoming the key decision makers in the purchase of software products**, if I'm the CEO of an open source company, I would definitely focus on the user experience and the community building.
