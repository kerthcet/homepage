8 bold conjectures about what AI will be like in 5 years and how it will change our lives:

1. There will be one world model out there, the most fundamental one for other models, governed by a consortium of governments and major corporations.

2. No more web browsers, no more text terminals, all we need is the AI-driven operating system that is interactive, multi-modal and agentic.

3. Agent job markets will emerge, people will hire AI agents to do their jobs and fire them once finished. The agents can be orchestrated by the AIOS under some protocols.

4. A new language specific for AI models will be invented to better understand the world, which is more efficient and concrete than natural language, and there will be translators between them.

5. Long-term context memory system will be widely adopted and developed, it will be a plug-and-play module for AI systems to store our preferences and history, just like we do today with hard disks.

6. The cloud AI will be responsible for scientist discoveries and medical breakthroughs while the edge AI will take care of our daily lives. Chips will be more powerful and models will be more compact.

7. Family workstations with AI built-in will be a must-have for everyone, just like fridges and TVs today. They will be the control plane of our digital life and much safer, cheaper and faster than centralized cloud AI.

8. A serious AI attack will occur at some time and people will start to realize how important AI safety is.
