A software engineer living in London, right now working at [Hiverge.ai](https://www.hiverge.ai/) as the founding engineer. Dreaming to establish a football club one day.

I have years of experience in cloud computing, distributed systems, DevOps & MLOps & LLMOps, now mainly focus on developing AI agents and LLM inference systems. I'm also the founder of [InftyAI](https://github.com/InftyAI), an open-source community committed to building solid AI infrastructure, like [llmaz](https://github.com/InftyAI/llmaz) and [AlphaTrion](https://github.com/InftyAI/alphatrion). Welcome to join us if you're interested.

Additionally, I work on upstream [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) community as SIG-Scheduling Maintainer and help incubate several projects like [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue), [LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws). Meanwhile, serving as the Tech Lead of the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Tag Workloads.

In my spare time, I run some side projects like [ModelSpec.ai](https://modelspec.ai/), which aims to deliver the latest AI trending news to the public.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss something related to AI, cloud, open source or starting a new business.
