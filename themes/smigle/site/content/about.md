{{< figure src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile" class="center-width-80-percent" >}}

A software engineer living in London, right now working for a stealth AI startup as the founding engineer.

I have years of experience in cloud computing, distributed systems, DevOps & MLOps & LLMOps, now mainly focus on developing AI agents and LLM inference.

I also work on upstream [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) as SIG-Scheduling Maintainer and help incubate several projects like [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue), [LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws) and more. Additionally, I'm the founder of [InftyAI](https://github.com/InftyAI), an opensource community committed to building solid AI infrastructures. Please join us if you're interested.

In my spare time, I run some side projects like [ModelSpec.ai](https://modelspec.ai/), which aims to deliver the latest AI trending news to the public.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss something related to AI, cloud, open source or starting a new business.
